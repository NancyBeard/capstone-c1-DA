# Final Project for Data Analyst Training by Correlation One

As part of my job-insertion plan in the United States, I identify the fundamental skillset I can apply in different areas.  
One of the things I enjoy the most is finding patterns in data using several tools, from visualization to modeling. However, being an alien in the country, nobody knows what you capable of doing are, and the value you can bring to a company. Additionally, I found that it is crucial to understand the workflow better.
Therefore, I made the decision to back to training. In this repository, I share the journey of my last project, which required getting a certificate in Data Analytics given by [Correlation One](https://www.correlation-one.com/)
