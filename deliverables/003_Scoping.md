## Business Problem

Many Americans today have chosen to rent housing vs. buying. Some of their choices are no maintenance costs to cover, no real estate taxes to pay, access to complimentary amenities, or even more flexibility if the renter decides to relocate. Rental properties were forced to lock in on current rental rates during the pandemic. However, now that Americans are returning to normalcy, rental rates have risen.

Typically, the highest rent increase was about 3% in the past. However, America is seeing at least an 11% increase from a year earlier, with some larger cities showing 30-40% increases. Unfortunately, the average renter's income is not increasing at these same rates, causing renters to become homeless. Even though many homeless people might be employed, they just cannot afford housing.

Our goal is to create a data-driven tool that will demonstrate whether there is a link between rising rent and homelessness in the United States.
