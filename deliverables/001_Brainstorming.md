**Problem 1**. Are the housing costs affecting homeless numbers in the US?

Reasons we find this question interesting:

*Reason 1*. Medical costs affected because of more exposure to the outdoor elements; individuals more at risk for disease.

*Reason 2*. Salaries are not increasing at the same rate as the increase in housing.

*Reason 3*. Social impact of an increase in crime.

**Problem 2**. Housing sales have declined because Feds increased interest rates.  How much compared to year 2008?

Reasons we find this question interesting:

*Reason 1*. People tend to postpone buying a house due to high price of the house and high interest rates.

*Reason 2*. If affects us all when there's a shortage of homes.

*Reason 3*. Low interest rates tend to increase demand for property.

**Problem 3**. Individual's credit score effects on new housing market

Reasons we find this question interesting:

*Reason 1*. Using credit for essential daily living costs which have increased

*Reason 2*. Market prefers cash or available funds for a house and individuals with lower credit scores have a difficult time bidding on homes.

*Reason 3*. What is the average credit score needed to qualify for a starter home?  (3 bedroom, 2 bath)

**Problem 4**. Compare the increased rent cost of the East Coast vs. West Coast.  How does the Midwest compare?

Reasons we find this question interesting:

*Reason 1*. More affordable in one geographic area therefore consider a move?

*Reason 2*. Does increased rent coincide with cost of living for other daily essentials?

*Reason 3*. Are there more individuals moving to one of the areas more than the other areas?
